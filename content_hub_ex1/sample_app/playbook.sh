# Semantex - Content Hub Example
The project provides a working example for Semantex's content hub APIs. For ease of use, 
a simple bash script provides syntactic suger wrappers for the cURL commands invoking the
various APIs.

For example a cURL based invocation of the REST endpoint (__/hub/apps/{id}/ingestion/pdf__) to ingest a 
PDF document: 
```$ curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/pdf' -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" "$BASE_URL/hub/apps/$APP_ID/ingestion/pdf" --upload-file "samples/letter-01.pdf"```

is wrapped by the following bash function __sem_add_pdf__, and therefore can be simplified to
```$ sem_add_pdf "samples/letter-01.pdf"```.

```sh
function sem_add_pdf() {
    curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/pdf' -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" "$BASE_URL/hub/apps/$APP_ID/ingestion/pdf" --upload-file "$1" | jq
}
```

## Installation

### Requirements
The following example requires *bash shell*, [cURL](https://curl.se/) and the [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) tool.  
Please ensure that they are in your path.

### Setup
Clone the git repository
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/semantex-ai/examples.git
```
This will create a folder __*examples*__ in your current directory.

Change into the following directory.
```sh
$ cd examples/content_hub_ex1
```

If you have a Semantex APIKEY, you should define it here[^1][^2].
[^1]: In case, you don't have an APIKEY, you can skip this step, however, please note  that you will be working in a public sandboxed environment, where your application content will be publically viewable. 
[^2]: You can register for a __free__ APIKEY at our [registration](https://semantex.ai/trial-sign-up/) page.
```sh
$ export API_KEY="889543c8-8e1a0583-d895af11-183205330bf"
```

Load the Semantex Content Hub Application cURL-based API wrapper functions.
```sh
$ source playbook.sh
```
```sh
$ sem_help
The following functions are available.
-) sem_display_config    -> Display the current configuration.

-) sem_create_app        -> Create a new application.
-) sem_delete_app        -> Delete an existing application.
-) sem_list_apps         -> Lists all applications.

-) sem_add_pdf            -> Add a single PDF file to an application via PDF ingestion API.
-) sem_list_app_docs      -> Lists all documents for a given application.
-) sem_list_app_countents -> Lists all content items for a given application.
-) sem_get_app_content    -> GET the content by content id for a given application.

-) sem_similarity_by_cid  -> Finds similar items given a content id across a given application.
-) sem_similarity_by_txt  -> Finds similar items given a text across a given application.
-) sem_text_search        -> Simple keyword based search.

-) sem_dep_check         -> Check for dependencies.
-) sem_cleanup           -> Cleanup the environment variables and functions.
```

# Example Scenario
In this example scenario, we will demonstrate some of the basic operations for a working with a content hub.

1. Create an application.
2. Index 3 PDF files.
3. List the documents of the application.
4. List of the content across all documents in the application.
5. Perform simple text search
6. Perform similarity search by
a. using a content as a query using content id.
b. using a text query.
7. Get details of a specific content by its id
9. Delete a document from the application
10. Delete the application.

## Create An Application
```sh
$ sem_create_app "My Test Semantex Application - 2023/05/19"
```
```json
{
  "status": {
    "success": true,
    "code": 200
  },
  "result": {
    "app-id": "b6ee555d61df4c0ae30099d3ba4acf5c-90e5588b"
  }
}
```
Take a note of the applcation id returned.

## Index PDF Files
```sh
$ sem_add_pdf samples/letter-01.pdf
```
```json
{
  "status": {
    "success": true,
    "code": 200
  },
  "result": {
    "did": "957bc66d",
    "cids": [
      "ead207e4",
      "e1c36dd1",
      "1bab2d28",
      "f6616c22",
      "468ace5b",
      "6eb1b4cc",
      "983b38fa",
      "68310d3e",
      "2a5f3898",
      "c4ce3e1b",
      "c915e6d7",
      "6955f407",
      "a6ceb20e",
      "c4d6a542",
      "150bf92a",
      "c5f971af"
    ]
  }
}
```
Index the other two PDFs as well.
```sh
$ sem_add_pdf samples/letter-02.pdf
$ sem_add_pdf samples/letter-03.pdf
```

## List Application Documents
```sh
$ sem_app_docs 
```
```json
{
  "status": {
    "success": true,
    "code": 200
  },
  "result": {
    "documents": [
      {
        "did": "315e5732",
        "size": 69
      },
      {
        "did": "4aae8d37",
        "size": 29
      },
      {

        "size": 16
      }
